An experimental game for my final output for Application Development! We were told to make a virtual pet game and this is what I've came up with.

<!-- 🦑 Description -->
Deep in the ocean lives a fascinating creature – the Kraken. While these legendary beasts are known to haunt the nightmares of sailors with their powerful tentacles and formidable beaks, they also have a more tender side. Imagine discovering a nest of Kraken eggs – would you take on the challenge of nurturing your very own pocket Kraken? Dive into this adventure and see if you have what it takes to raise these mythical sea creatures!
